```

#### Pre-requisites:

1. Active NodeJS LTS (Long Term Support) version and associated supported NPM version.  (See https://nodejs.org)
#### Library Management SAPUI5 Application
This SAPUI5 application serves as a library management system, providing functionalities like user authentication, navigation, user registration, and managing book-related data. It integrates with an OData service to perform CRUD operations on the backend.
#### Features

.Displays a list of navigable pages including:
.Home
.Student Registration
.Student Category Registration
.Book Issue Log Form
.Books Return Form
.Branches Form
.Books
.Book Categories
.Implements onItemSelect for page routing using the router.
3. User Authentication
.Login functionality (onLoginPress) to validate user credentials against OData records.
.Displays success or error messages based on authentication results.
4. User Registration
.Modal-based user registration using a custom fragment (leftmenu.view.RegisterUser).
.Fields include User ID, Name, Username, and Password.
.Validation checks:
.Ensures all fields are filled.
